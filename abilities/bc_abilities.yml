    you may use this ability to overcharge the spell cast with that slot.
    Any damage dealt by the spell uses \textbf{exploding dice}.
    When you roll the maximum value on an exploding die,
    you may roll that die again.
    If the result is the maximum again,
    you roll the die a further time,
    and so on until the maximum has no longer been rolled.
