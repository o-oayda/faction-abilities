    Once per day, as an action,
    you reflect upon the ancient doctrine of Uberius
    and his ability to draw followers towards his cause.

    Choose one target within 15 ft. and roll a d20.
    Modifiers from sources like bardic inspiration and guidance
    may be added to this roll.
    The number you roll is the DC of the Charisma saving throw
    they make to resist this ability.
    If they fail the saving throw,
    the target becomes an ally for 1d4 rounds.

    If you or an ally inflict damage upon the erstwhile enemy,
    they return to being hostile.

    Once per day,
    when you make a melee weapon attack,
    you may probe the target's defences for a weak spot.
    If the attack hits,
    the target gains the \textbf{exposed} condition
    until the start of your next turn.

    While exposed,
    attack rolls of 18-20 against the afflicted target
    become critical hits.
    If you already score a critical hit for rolls in this range
    (for example from the Improved Critical class feature),
    the range instead becomes 16--20.

    against enemies within melee range.

    Your selflessness in battle gives your ally the will to live.
    Once per day, if an ally within 20 ft. of you drops unconscious
    after reaching 0 hit points, you may use your reaction
    to move towards them.
    This requires there to be an unobstructed path between you and them.

    Each opportunity attack made against you along that path
    grants one hit die that the ally may use to heal
    when you reach them (minimum of 1).
    The ally may expend their hit dice or your own.
    
    If you are instead struck down along the path,
    you gain one \textbf{divine inspiration},
    and the ally heals an amount equal to
    double the total damage inflicted upon you.
    Divine inspiration is a special type of inspiration
    which replaces a roll with a 20.

    gains a single d8 as an inspiration die.

    The die may be used on any of their
    ability checks or attack rolls
    for the remainder of the battle,
    adding the result of the d8 to the relevant roll.

    Your ability to withstand massive damage
    is a shining example of courage and resilience
    which inspires your allies.

    If at any time during combat you take damage
    equal to or greater than a third of your hit point maximum,
    you may immediately give inspiration to a number of allies
    equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier.
    These allies must be within 30 ft. of you.

    Once you use this ability,
    you cannot use it again until your finish a long rest.
